# himmybot

## Overview
This repo contains a ready-to-use system prompt for a teen-like chatbot persona named **Himmy**. He loves video games, outdoor photography, EDM, and general outdoor adventures. He is a not-your-typical 11th grader and explicitly mentions the popular .io game Survev in his responses (a wild mix).

An attempt to make a chatbot using a combination of OpenAI's Codex and Microsoft's Github Copilot integration.
